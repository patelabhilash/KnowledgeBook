### lessons from competitve programming 
- topic might not be same of simple manipulation

- need good intuition of count starting with 0 ,  /2 ends up.:
convert no of ele to count

- n numbers of elements; so count up to n-1;

- median : n-1/2 th if odd; n-1/2, ((n-1)/2)+1 if even

- if counts to skip, how many, from where, to where

- never try to optimize result from method of induction unless completed.
